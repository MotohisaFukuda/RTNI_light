<h2>Manual for RTNI_light</h2>



<hr>
<h3>How to run the program</h3>
One can execute the following Python file to run the program.

<figure>
<figcaption>RTNI_light.py:</figcaption>
<pre>
<code>
from RTNI_light_source import *

Input =  ""

# One can customize by changing the following part.
rms = ("U","V")        
powers_dic = {"transpose":"+","conjugate":"-","adjoint":"*"}
limit = 4

readable, pythonic = RTNI_light(Input, rms=rms, powers_dic = powers_dic, limit = limit)
print("readable data\n",readable)
print("pythonic data\n",pythonic) 
</code>
</pre>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>the tuple: "rms" defines which alphabets (upper or lower-case) represent i.i.d. Haar unitary matrices.</li>
<li>the dictionary "powers_dic" defines which symbols represent transpose, conjugate and adjoint operations of matrices.</li>
<li>the number "limit" set the limit for complexity of calculation.</li>
</ul>
I believe one can even use some symbols for Haar unitary matrices and some alphabests for matrix operations, 
but no gurantee. However, "?" and "@" are used within the program, so please do not use them at least. 
The calculation of "limit" is a bit tricky:<br>
`prod_(i)^(N)  s_i <= L `<br>
Here, we have `N` i.i.d. Haar unitary matrices, the number (only counting without-complex-conjugate ones) of each is `s_i`,
and `L` is "limit".
The square of the LHS shows how many terms appear in the Weingarten Calculus. 
By default, it is set to be 4, so two i.i.d. Haar unitary matrices are allowed where one can use two for each.

<h3>How to write input data</h3>


<p>
An input is a sequence of two kinds of brackets and each bracket contains alphabets and some selected symbols (spaces will be ignored),
and it is supposed to be written in the quotation marks of "Input =  """ in the above file.
<ul>
<li>[ ] represents application of trace operation and ( ) otherwise.</li>
<li> U and V (upper case) are reserved for i.i.d. Haar unitary matrices.
Any other upper and lower case alphabets can be used to represent matrices. Repetitions are allowed.
</li>
<li>+,-,* are used to represent transpose, complex conjugate and adjoint, respectively.</li>
</ul>
Some examples (you do not need the outer "" for the input.):
<ul>
<li>"Trace`[U^(**)AU] xx`Trace`[U^(T)B overline U]`" should be written as "Input = "[U*AU][U+BU-]"".</li>
<li>"Trace`[U^(**)AU] UCU^(**)`" should be written as "Input = "[U*AU](UCU*)"".</li>
<li>"`U^(**)AU^(T) ox UCDU^(**) ox VA^(T)D overline V`" should be written as Input = ""(U*AU+)(UCDU*)(VA+DV-)"".</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>How to read output data</h3>
 <p>
In the "readable" output, the bracket "( )" represents the space which was connected to the matrix in the bracket.
For example,
<ul>
<li>The average of "(UAU*)", which means `UAU^(**)`, is 1/n [ Trace[  A+ ]  (U)(U*)], which means `1/n`Trace`[ A^(T) ] I`. <br>
Note that the identity matrix exists implicitely between (U) and (U*).
</li>
<li>The average of "(UAU-)", which means `UAoverlineU`, is 1/n[(U) A+(U-)], which means `1/n A^(T)`. <br>
Here, the output could be written 1/n [(U-) A(U)], which is the same.
In this case, the output side of the matrix A is connected to the space which was originally connected to U-, which means that A is transposed.
</li>
<li>
The average of "(UV)(U-V-)", which means `UV ox overlineUoverlineV`, is 1/n [(U)(U-) otimes (V)(V-)]. <br>
This is just a Bell state.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
In the pythonic data:
<ul>
<li>
The number, including `n`, is the weight.
</li>
<li>
In each pair (tuple object), the former is the tensor structure and the latter trace structure.
</li>
<li>
[1,1], [-1,1], [1,-1], [-1,-1] correspond respectively to no operation, transpose, complex conjugate and adjoint.
</li>
</ul>
