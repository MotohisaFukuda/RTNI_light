# RTNI_light
## Integration with respect to the Haar unitary.

With RTNI_light one can integrate matrices symbolically with respect to Haar unitary matrices of size n.
RTNI_light is a light and user-friendly version of the program called RTNI, originally developped in the following paper: <br/>
M. Fukuda, R. Koenig, I. Nechita "RTNI - A symbolic integrator for Haar-random tensor networks",<br/>
[arXiv:1902.08539 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08539).

The programs of the above paper can be found at the GitHub page:<br/>
[RTNI at GitHub](https://github.com/MotohisaFukuda/RTNI).

The web-version of RTNI_light can be found at the pythonanywhere website:<br/>
[RTNI_light web](https://motohisafukuda.pythonanywhere.com)<br/>
but there are limitations to save computational resource of the server.
